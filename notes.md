# topics learned while going through the project

## Database
- STI (Single Table Inheritance)
  - which is when you have a single table for multiple models that share common attributes
- MTI (Multi Table Inheritance)
  - which is when you have separate tables for each model that share common attribute in a parent table

## Software Engineering 
### Task Estimation
- estimates can't be on the spot guesses you have to think and have an image of the task you're doing.
- estimates are basically guesses into the future but here are some tips that can help the guess be more accurate:
  1. split work into chunks (env setup, db design, class design, etc...)
  1. estimate the time for each chunk (based on previous experience)
  1. add some slack for issues that might come up
