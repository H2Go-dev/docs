# topics learned while going through the project

## Spring

### Java Records and Lombok
- Java Records
  - they are a special kind of class that is concise and immutable by default
  - they automatically generate boilerplate code like constructors, getters, equals, hashCode, and toString methods
  - syntax example:
    ```java
    public record Person(String name, int age) {}
    ```
  - limitations:
    - cannot extend other classes (but can implement interfaces)
    - all fields are final (immutable)
    - no-arg constructor is not generated by default
    - constructor gets very verbose with many fields

- Lombok
  - is a java library that helps reduce boilerplate code (https://www.baeldung.com/intro-to-project-lombok
  - it uses annotations to generate code at compile time
  - some common annotations:
    - @Data: generates getters, setters, toString, equals, and hashCode methods
    - @Getter/@Setter: generates getters and setters for fields
      - @Getter(lazy=true): generates a lazy getter
      - it can be applied at class level to generate for all fields
    - @NoArgsConstructor: generates a no-argument constructor
    - @AllArgsConstructor: generates a constructor with all fields as parameters
    - @Builder: implements the builder pattern for object creation

  - conculsion:
    - use records when you need simple, immutable data carriers with minimal boilerplate
    - use Lombok when you need more flexibility, mutability, or want to reduce boilerplate in complex classes

## Database
- STI (Single Table Inheritance)
  - which is when you have a single table for multiple models that share common attributes
- MTI (Multi Table Inheritance)
  - which is when you have separate tables for each model that share common attribute in a parent table

## Software Engineering 

### Task Estimation

- estimates can't be on the spot guesses you have to think and have an image of the task you're doing.
- estimates are basically guesses into the future but here are some tips that can help the guess be more accurate:
  1. split work into chunks (env setup, db design, class design, etc...)
  1. estimate the time for each chunk (based on previous experience)
  1. add some slack for issues that might come up
